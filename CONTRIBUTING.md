# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Create a new issue](https://github.com/vnappmob/qrquick/issues) for features, bugs fix requested
  * [How to support on translation](https://github.com/vnappmob/qrquick/tree/master/lib/l10n)

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [hi@vnappmob.com](mailto:hi@vnappmob.com).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/vnappmob/qrquick/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear and simple log message for your commits:

    $ git commit -m "Summary of solving issues #1"

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
